# Asymptotic Properties of Estimators {#sec-asy}

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
library(tidyverse)
library(gganimate)
```

When considering estimators in @sec-est, we kept the sample size
$n$ fixed when assessing estimators. We now consider how estimators
behave as $n\to\infty.$ In practice, we will never have infinite data,
asymptotics gives us an approximate idea of how estimators perform for
large data sets. A comprehensive reference in asymptotic theory is due
to @van2000asymptotic. For a treatment concerned purely with
econometrics, @newey1994large provide a phenomenal survey, most of which
we will touch on when discussing general classes of estimators.\
      With loss of some generality, we will assume that all random
variables have finite expectation and variances. Dispensing with this
assumption is something for a probability course.

## Convergence

At some point in high school, most students encounter the concept of a
numeric sequence, and how they can converge to a limit. Later on,
perhaps when taking a real analysis course, sequences are generalized to
spaces of functions. A sequence of functions may also converge to a
limit, whether that be converging pointwise and/or converging uniformly
(for details see @rudin1976principles). Random variables are functions
from a sample space to $\mathbb R$, so we can consider how these
functions converge. 

### Convergence in MSE

The first type of convergence we'll work with deals with MSE.

::: {#def-}
A sequence of random variables $X_n$ [***converges in mean
square***]{style="color:red"} to a random variable $X$, written as
$X_n\overset{ms}{\to} X$, if
$$\lim_{n\to\infty} \text{E}\left[(X_n - X)^2\right] = 0.$$ A sequence
of random vectors $\mathbf{X}_n = (X_{1,n},\ldots X_{k,n})$ converges in
mean square to $\mathbf{X}$ if $X_{i,n}\overset{ms}{\to} X_i$ for
$i=1,\ldots, k$.
:::

      $X_n \overset{ms}{\to}X$ if the average distance between $X_n$ and
$X$ shrinks as $n\to\infty$ where distance is measured as $(X_n - X)^2$.
We can also have $X_n \overset{ms}{\to}c$ for some constant $c$, as $c$
is a trivial random variable.

::: {#exm-}
Suppose we draw a sample of $n$ iid random variables $Z_i$ and define
$X_n$ to be the sample mean of our observations.
$$X_n = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n Z_i$$ If
$\text{E}\left[Z_i\right] = \mu$ and
$\text{Var}\left(Z_i\right) = \sigma^2$ for all $i$, we have
$X_n\overset{ms}{\to}\mu$: \begin{align*}
\lim_{n\to\infty}\text{E}\left[(X_n - \mu)^2\right] & = \lim_{n\to\infty}\text{Var}\left(X_n\right) + \text{Bias}(X_n) \\
&= \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\sigma^2}{n} + 0 & (X_n \text{ unbiased}) \\
& = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\sigma^2}{n} \\
& = 0.
\end{align*}

What does this convergence "look like"? If
$Z_i\overset{iid}{\sim}N(0,1)$, we know that
$X_n = \bar Z \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2/n)$. Let's plot this distribution for
increasing values of $n$.

```
:::

      This example betrays a useful property related to variables which
converge in mean square.

::: {#prp-mse3}
A sequence of random variables $X_n$ converges in mean square to a
constant $c$ *if and only if* $\text{E}\left[X_n\right]\to c$ and
$\text{Var}\left(X_n\right)\to 0$.
:::

::: proof
[space]{style="color:white"}

$(\Longrightarrow)$ Suppose $X_n \overset{ms}{\to}c$. Then
\begin{align*}
& \lim_{n\to\infty}\text{E}\left[(X_n - c)^2\right] = 0\\
 \implies & \lim_{n\to\infty}\text{E}\left[(X_n - c)^2\right] = 0\\
 \implies& \lim_{n\to\infty}\left[\text{E}\left[X_n\right]^2 -2c \text{E}\left[X_n\right] + c^2\right]= 0\\
 \implies& \lim_{n\to\infty}\left[(\text{E}\left[X_n\right]^2 -\text{E}\left[X_n\right]^2) + \text{E}\left[X_n\right]^2 - 2c \text{E}\left[X_n\right] + c^2\right]= 0 \\ 
 \implies &\lim_{n\to\infty} \text{Var}\left(X_n\right) + \lim_{n\to\infty}\left[\text{E}\left[X_n\right] -c\right]^2 = 0 
\end{align*} This final equality gives the desired result.

$(\Longleftarrow)$ Suppose $\text{E}\left[X_n\right]\to c$ and
$\text{Var}\left(X_n\right)\to 0$. We have \begin{align*}
&\lim_{n\to\infty} \text{Var}\left(X_n\right) + \lim_{n\to\infty}\left[\text{E}\left[X_n\right] -c\right]^2 = 0 \\
\implies & \lim_{n\to\infty}\text{E}\left[(X_n - c)^2\right] = 0\\
\implies & X_n\overset{ms}{\to}c
\end{align*}
:::

::: {#cor-mseconv}
Suppose $X_n$ is a sequence of random variables such that
$\text{E}\left[X_n\right] = c$ for all $n$. Then $X_n\overset{ms}{\to}c$
*if and only if* $\text{Var}\left(X_n\right)\to 0$.
:::

### Convergence in Probability

Convergence in mean square captures the idea that a random variable gets
"closer" to some value $c,$ but it is hardly the only way to define this
behavior. A more "traditional" approach would be defining convergence
using an inequality involving an arbitrarily small $\varepsilon >0$
(akin the to $\varepsilon-\delta$ definition of a limit).

::: {#def-}
A sequence of random variables $X_n$ [***converges in
probability***]{style="color:red"} to a random variable $X$, written as
$X_n\overset{p}{\to}X$ or $\mathop{\mathrm{plim}}X_n = X$, if
$$\lim_{n\to\infty} \Pr (|X_n - X| > \varepsilon)= 0$$ for all
$\varepsilon > 0$. Equivalently, $X_n\overset{p}{\to}X$ if for all
$\varepsilon > 0$ and $\delta > 0$, there exists some $N$ such that for
all $n \ge N$, $$ \Pr (|X_n - X| > \varepsilon) < \delta.$$ A sequence
of random vectors $\mathbf{X}_n = (X_{1,n},\ldots X_{k,n})$ converges in
probability to $\mathbf{X}$ if $X_{i,n}\overset{p}{\to} X_i$ for
$i=1,\ldots, k$.
:::

      Intuitively, $X_n \overset{p}{\to}X$ if the probability that the
difference $|X_n - X|$ is not small (greater than some $\varepsilon$)
goes to zero as $n\to\infty$. In other words, for large values of $n$, there is 
a large probability that $X_n$ is close to $X$

::: {#exm-}
Return to the previous example where $X_n = \bar Z$, and assume
$Z_i \overset{iid}{\sim}N(\mu,\sigma^2)$. We will verify that
$X_n\overset{p}{\to}\mu$ using the definition of convergence in
probability using the fact that $X_n \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2/n)$.

knitr::include_graphics("figures/converge.png")
```

For some $\varepsilon > 0$, \begin{align*}
\Pr (|X_n - \mu| > \varepsilon) & = 1 - \Pr (\mu - \varepsilon < X_n < \mu + \varepsilon)\\
& = 1 - (F_{X_n}(\mu + \varepsilon) + F_{X_n}(\mu - \varepsilon))\\
& = 1 - 2\left[F_{X_n}(\mu + \varepsilon) - \frac{1}{2}\right] & (F_{X_n} \text{symmetric about }\mu)\\
 & = 1 - 2\left[\Phi\left(\frac{(\mu + \varepsilon) - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}\right) - \frac{1}{2}\right] & (\Phi\text{ standard normal distribution})\\
 & = 1 - 2\left[\Phi\left(\frac{\varepsilon}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}\right) - \frac{1}{2}\right].
\end{align*} Given some $\delta >0$, we can solve for the lowest value
of $n$ that satisfies $\Pr (|X_n - c| > \varepsilon) < \delta$.
\begin{align*}
&\Pr (|X_n - c| > \varepsilon) < \delta \\ 
\implies & 1 - 2\left[\Phi\left(\frac{\varepsilon}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}\right) - \frac{1}{2}\right] < \delta \\
\implies&  n > \left(\frac{\sigma \Phi^{-1}(1-\delta/2)}{\varepsilon}\right)^2
\\\implies & n > \left\lceil \left(\frac{\sigma \Phi^{-1}(1-\delta/2)}{\varepsilon}\right)^2 \right\rceil
\end{align*} Just to be excruciatingly pedantic, we rounded our solution
up to the closest positive integer, as $n$ corresponds to a sample size.
For fixed values of $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ (say 3 and 2, respectively), we
can define a function of $(\varepsilon, \delta)$ which calculates the
sample size required to satisfy $\Pr(|X_n - c|>\varepsilon)<\delta$.

```{r}
n_fun <- function(delta, ep, mu, sigma){
 ceiling(((sigma*qnorm(1-delta /2))/ep)^2) 
}
```

Let's plot this function for various values of $(\varepsilon, \delta)$.

:::

      How does convergence in mean square related to convergence in
probability? As it turns out the latter is a weaker condition implied by
the prior. Before stating and proving this result, we will need a lemma.

::: {#lem-markovineq}
## Markov's inequality

If $X$ is a nonnegative random variable, and $a > 0$, then
$$\Pr(X\ge a) \le \frac{\text{E}\left[X\right]}{a}$$
:::

::: proof
The expectation of $X$ can be written as \begin{align*}
\text{E}\left[X\right] & = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x\ dF_X(x) \\ 
& = \int_{0}^\infty x\ dF_X(x) & (X\text{ is nonnegative}) \\ 
& = \int_{0}^a x\ dF_X(x) + \int_{a}^\infty x\ dF_X(x) \\ 
& \ge \int_a^\infty x\ dF_X(x)\\
& \ge \int_a^\infty a\ dF_X(x) & (a \ge x \text{ on }(a,\infty))\\
& = a \int_a^\infty\ dF_X(x) \\
& = a\Pr(X \ge a).
\end{align*} Dividing both sides of this inequality by $a$ gives
$\Pr(X\ge a) \le \text{E}\left[X\right]/a$.
:::

::: {#prp-conv}
## Convergence in MSE --\> Convergence in Probability

Let $X_n$ be a sequence of random variables. If $X_n\overset{ms}{\to}X$,
then $X_n\overset{p}{\to}X$.
:::

::: proof
Suppose $X_n\overset{ms}{\to}X$. For all $\varepsilon > 0$
\begin{align*}
\lim_{n\to\infty} \Pr (|X_n - X| > \varepsilon) & = \lim_{n\to\infty} \Pr ((X_n - X)^2 > \varepsilon^2) \\
& \le \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\text{E}\left[(X_n - X)^2\right]}{\varepsilon^2} & (\text{Markov's Inequality}) \\
& = \frac{0}{\varepsilon^2} & (X_n\overset{ms}{\to}X)\\
& = 0.
\end{align*} Therefore $X_n\overset{p}{\to}c$.
:::

      The usefulness of @prp-conv cannot be emphasized enough. Proving
convergence in probability using the definition is cumbersome, so we
will almost show convergence in mean square and then appeal to @prp-conv
to verify convergence in probability. Nevertheless, situations can arise
where $X_n\overset{p}{\to} X$, but $X_n \not\overset{ms}{\to} X$.

::: {#exm-pnotmse}

## Convergence in Probability but not in Mean Square

Suppose $X_n$ is defined on the sample space $\{1,n^2\}$ such that:
\begin{align*}
\Pr(X_n = 0) &= 1-1/n\\
\Pr(X_n = n^2) &= 1/n
\end{align*}

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| label: fig-plot24.2
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-asp: 0.7
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-cap: "The probability density function associated with X_n for increasing values of n."
#| code-summary: "Show code which generates figure"
expand_grid(n = 1:50, x = 0:1) %>% 
  mutate(
    x = x*(n^2),
    p = (1-1/n)*(x == 0) + (1/n)*(x != 0)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = p)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_segment(aes(x = x, xend = x, y = 0, yend = p)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_sqrt(breaks = (1:10)*500) + 
  labs(color = "n", y = "Probability Density", x = "X_n") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")  + 
  transition_states(n) +
  labs(title = 'n = {closest_state}')
```
The expected value of $X_n$ is
$$\text{E}\left[X_n\right] = 0(1-1/n) + n^2(1/n) = n,$$ so
$\text{E}\left[X_n\right]\to\infty$ as $n\to \infty$. This rules out
$X_n$ converging in mean square to any value. Nevertheless, we have
$X_n\overset{p}{\to}0$. For all $\varepsilon > 0$,
$$\Pr(|X_n - 0| > \varepsilon) = \Pr(X_n \neq 0) = \Pr(X_n = n^2) = 1/n \to 0.$$
This disagreement among definitions of convergence arises because the convergence in probability
only takes into consideration the probability assigned to each value in the sample space, whereas convergence in MSE is based on an expectation which takes into consideration the probability assigned to each value in the sample space *weighted* by the value in the sample space. In this particular example, the probability that $X_n = n^2$ is $1/n$, and the growth of $n^2$ as $n\to \infty$ outpaces the growth of $1/n$, so the expected value of $X_n$ grows indefinitely.
:::


::: remark 
We can think of the counterexample in @exm-pnotmse arising from the "tail" of a density, where the "tail" happened to just be a single point because the random variable was discrete. This is a pattern that comes up often in asymptotics -- the tails of distributions and densities can cause trouble. Many theorems and results depend on these tails behaving well.
:::

### Almost Sure Convergence

An third type of convergence is almost sure convergence. Recalling that a random variable is just a function, we can define a stochastic analog to pointwise convergence of a sequence of functions. 

::: {#def-}
A sequence of random variables $X_n$ [***converges almost surely***]{style="color:red"} to a random variable $X$, written as
$X_n\overset{a.s}{\to}X$ if
$$ \Pr \left(\lim_{n\to\infty} X_n = X\right) = 1.$$ A sequence
of random vectors $\mathbf{X}_n = (X_{1,n},\ldots X_{k,n})$ converges almost surely to $\mathbf{X}$ if $X_{i,n}\overset{a.s}{\to} X_i$ for
$i=1,\ldots, k$.
:::

       Almost sure convergence is the probabilistic equivalent of a sequence of functions converging pointwise almost everywhere. The difference between $X_n\overset{a.s}{\to} X$ and $X_n\pto X$ is subtle, and arises from the limit being taken before or after we take the probability of the event. While convergence in probability tells us that the chance that $X_n$ and $X$ are far approaches zero, almost sure convergence says that the probability that $X_n\to X$ as $n\to \infty$ is 1. We're certain that $X_n$ will eventually coincide with $X$, although we don't know when that will happen. The next example makes the difference between these two definitions a bit more concrete. Later on in @exm-strongvsweak an illustration will be presented to distinguish the two definitions.

::: {#exm-}

## Convergence in Probability but not in Almost Surely

Define $X_n$ on $\{0,1\}$ such that: 
\begin{align*}
\Pr(X_n = 1) & = 1/n\\
\Pr(X_n = 0) & = 1-1/n
\end{align*}
We have $X_n\pto 0$ since 
$$ \lim_{n\to\infty}\Pr(|X_n - 0| > \varepsilon) =  \lim_{n\to\infty}\Pr(X_n > \varepsilon) = \lim_{n\to\infty}\Pr(X_n = 1) = \lim_{n\to\infty} 1/n = 0$$ for all $\varepsilon > 0$.
At the same time, we have 
$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \Pr(X_n = 1) =  \sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/n = \infty,$$ so by a form of the [Borel-Cantelli Lemma](http://www.columbia.edu/~ks20/stochastic-I/stochastic-I-BC.pdf) then $X_n = 1$ occurs an infinite number of times. This rules out the possibility that $\lim_{n\to\infty} X_n = 0$ with probability 1.

:::

::: {#prp-}

## Convergence A.S -> Convergence in Probability

Let $X_n$ be a sequence of random variables. If $X_n\overset{a.s}\to X$ then $X_n\pto X$. 

:::

       The proof of this result can be found in @van2000asymptotic. Almost sure convergence is not nearly as important as convergence in probability when it comes to assessing estimators. In fact, @lehmann1999elements doesn't even mention it in his treatment of asymptotic statistics. The math underlying almost sure convergence is also a bit complex, so the related proofs aren't very informative and will be omitted.

### Convergence in Distribution

The final notion of convergence we will use related to the probability
distribution of random variables.

:::{#def-}
A sequence of random variables $X_n$ [***converges in distribution
(converges weakly)***]{style="color:red"} to a random variable $X$,
written as $X_n \overset{d}{\to}X$, if
$$\lim_{n\to\infty} F_{X_n}(x)= F_X(x)$$ for all points $x$ where $F_{X}$ is continuous. In this case, we refer to
$F_X$ as the [***asymptotic distribution***]{style="color:red"} of
$X_n$, and write $X_n \overset{a}{\sim}F_X$.^[Convergence in distribution is also sometimes called convergence in law among mathematicians. The notation for this form of convergence is also as varied as it's name. Some other ways of writing $X_n\overset{d}{\to} X$ are: $X_n\rightsquigarrow X$, $X_n\Rightarrow X$, $X_n \overset{\mathcal L}\to X$, $\mathcal L(X_n) \to \mathcal L(X)$.] A sequence
of random vectors $\mathbf{X}_n = (X_{1,n},\ldots X_{k,n})$ converges in distribution to $\X$ if $\lim_{n\to\infty} F_{\X_n}(x)= F_{\X}(x)$.
:::

      For our purposes, $X_n\overset{d}{\to}X$ means the distribution of $X_n$
can be approximated by $F_X$, and this approximation becomes
increasingly better as $n\to\infty$.

::: {#exm-tdist}
One example of convergence in distribution you may be familiar with
deals with the student's $t-$distribution where the degrees of freedom
$n\to\infty$. If $X_n\sim t_n$, then $X_n \overset{d}{\to}X$ where
$X\sim N(0,1)$.

\Pr(X_n \le x) & = \Pr(X_n\le x \text{ and } X \le x + \varepsilon) + \Pr(X_n\le x \text{ and } X > x + \varepsilon) \\
  & = \Pr(X \le x + \varepsilon) + \Pr(X_n - X\le x - X \text{ and } x - X < -\varepsilon)\\ 
  & \le \Pr(X \le x + \varepsilon) + \Pr(X_n - X < -\varepsilon)\\
  & \le \Pr(X \le x + \varepsilon) + \Pr(X_n - X < -\varepsilon) + \Pr(X - X_n > \varepsilon) \\
  & = \Pr(X \le x + \varepsilon) + \Pr(|X_n - X| > \varepsilon)
\end{align*} Similarly,
$$ \Pr(X \le x-\varepsilon) \le \Pr(X_n \le x) + \Pr(|X_n - X| > \varepsilon).$$
We can use these inequalities to find an upper and lower bound of
$\Pr(X_n \le x)$: 

::: {.column-screen-inset-right}
\begin{align*}
& \Pr(X \le x-\varepsilon) - \Pr(|X_n - X| > \varepsilon)\le \Pr(X_n \le x) \le \Pr(X \le x + \varepsilon) + \Pr(|X_n - X| > \varepsilon) \\
\implies & \lim_{n\to\infty}[\Pr(X \le x-\varepsilon) - \Pr(|X_n - X| > \varepsilon)]\le \lim_{n\to\infty}\Pr(X_n \le x) \le \lim_{n\to\infty}[\Pr(X \le x + \varepsilon) + \Pr(|X_n - X| > \varepsilon) ]\\
\implies & \Pr(X \le x-\varepsilon) - \underbrace{\lim_{n\to\infty}\Pr(|X_n - X| > \varepsilon) }_0\le \lim_{n\to\infty}\Pr(X_n \le x) \le \Pr(X \le x + \varepsilon) + \underbrace{\lim_{n\to\infty}\Pr(|X_n - X| > \varepsilon)}_0 \\
\implies & \Pr(X \le x-\varepsilon)\le \lim_{n\to\infty} \Pr(X_n \le x) \le  \Pr(X \le x + \varepsilon) & (X_n\overset{p}{\to}X)\\ 
\implies & F_X(x-\varepsilon)\le \lim_{n\to\infty} F_{X_n}(x) \le  F_X(x-\varepsilon) 
\end{align*}
:::

This holds for all $\varepsilon > 0$, so it must be the
case that $\lim_{n\to\infty} F_{X_n}(x) = F_X(x)$
:::

       Of the different concepts of stochastic convergence, convergence in distribution is the weakest (as the alternate name weak convergence implies). If $X_n \overset{d}{\to} X$, we're not saying that $X_n$ and $X$ become close, or that the probability that $X_n$ and $X$ are close approaches 1. We're saying that, given a common probability space $(\mathcal X, \mathcal F, P)$,^[The probability space on which the sequence of random variables is defined need not be common, but assume as much for the sake of this digression.] that the distribution function $F_{X_n}$ defined via the distribution $P(X^{-1}(I))$^[where $I\subseteq \mathcal B(\mathbb R)$] happens to converge to the same function corresponding to the random variable $X$. Furthermore, the convergence of $F_{X_n}$ to $F_X$ only needs to occur at the points which $F_X$ is continuous, *and* even then the convergence only needs to be pointwise (opposed to uniform).

:::

### Putting the Pieces Together

The biggest takeaway from this should be the following relations:
\begin{align*}
&X_n \overset{ms}{\to}X \implies X_n \overset{p}{\to}X \implies X_n \overset{d}{\to}X\\
&X_n \overset{a.s}{\to}X \implies X_n \overset{p}{\to}X
\end{align*}


## Consistency

Our three modes of convergence were defined for any sequence of random
variables. It should come as no surprise, considering the previous
examples considering whether the sample mean converged, that we are
interested in the convergence of estimators $\hat\theta(\mathbf{X})$ as
sample size increases. In particular we are interested in whether
$\hat\theta(\mathbf{X})$ converges to the constant $\theta\in\Theta$ it
is estimating.

:::{#def-}
An estimator $\hat\theta$ is [***consistent (for estimand***
$\theta$)]{style="color:red"} if $\hat\theta \overset{p}{\to}\theta$.
:::

       We've already seen that $\bar X$ is a consistent estimator for $\mu$
when we take an iid sample from a normal distribution. Let's investigate
it's variance-counterpart $S^2$.

::: {#exm-consvarnorm}
For $X_i \overset{iid}{\sim}N(\mu,\sigma^2)$,
$S^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar X)/(n-1)$ is an unbiased estimator for
$\sigma^2$. This estimator's MSE (which is just its variance as it is
unbiased) is $2\sigma^4/(n-1)$ which converges to $0$ as $n\to\infty$,
so $S^2$ is consistent by @prp-conv.
:::

       This example highlights the fact that proving an unbiased estimator is
consistent is a matter of showing its variance converges to 0.

::: {#cor-unbcon}
Suppose $\hat\theta$ is an unbiased estimator for $\theta$. Then
$\hat\theta$ is consistent *if and only if*
$\text{Var}\left(\hat\theta\right)\to 0$.
:::

::: proof
Apply @cor-mseconv to an unbiased estimator.
:::

      A second type of convergence related to estimators pertains to the bias
of an estimator. In @sec-est we saw a few estimators that were biased,
but this bias was such that it diminished as $n\to\infty$. In effect,
they were unbiased in an asymptotic sense.

:::{#def-}

An estimator $\hat\theta$ is [***asymptotically
unbiased***]{style="color:red"} if
$\lim_{n\to\infty}\text{Bias}(\hat\theta, \theta) = 0$.

:::

:::{#exm}
For $X_i \overset{iid}{\sim}N(\mu,\sigma^2)$,
$\hat\theta = \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar X)/n$ is a biased estimator for
$\sigma^2$. Its bias is
$$\text{Bias}(\hat\theta, \sigma^2) = \frac{n-1}{n}\sigma^2 - \sigma^2.$$
As $n\to\infty$, this bias vanishes. To illustrate this, we can simulate
estimates for various sample sizes, taking $X_i \sim N(0,1)$.

```{r}
draw_estimate <- function(theta, n, dist, dist_params, s){
  X <- do.call(dist, append(n, dist_params))
  output <- tibble(
    sample_size = n,
    iter_num = s,
    estimate = theta(X)
  )
  return(output)
}

draw_N_estimates <- function(theta, N, n, dist, dist_params){
  output <- 1:N %>% 
    map_df(\(s) draw_estimate(theta, n, dist, dist_params, s)) 
  return(output)
}

draw_N_estimates_over_n <- function(theta, N, n_vals, dist, dist_params){
  output <- n_vals %>% 
    map_df(\(n) draw_N_estimates(theta, N, n, dist, dist_params)) 
  return(output)
}

results <- draw_N_estimates_over_n(
  theta = function(X){sum((X - mean(X))^2)/length(X)},
  N = 1e6,
  n_vals = c(10, 25, 50, 100, 500),
  dist = rnorm,
  dist_params = list(
    mean = 0,
    sd = 1
  )
)

#Print bias calculated over 1,000,000 simulations
results %>% 
  group_by(sample_size) %>% 
  summarize(bias = mean(estimate) - 1)
```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| label: fig-plot26
#| fig-align: center

  xlim(0,2) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  labs(x = "Estimates of Variance, True Value = 1", y = "Density", color = "Sample Size")
```

The estimator $\hat\theta$ is also consistent, as it converges in mean
square.

:::

       Asymptotic unbiasedness does not imply consistency, and
consistency does not imply asymptotic unbiasedness.

:::{#exm-}

## Consistent, Not Asymptotically Unbiased

Recall that the sequence of discrete random variables $X_n$ with denisty
$$ f_{X_n}(x) = \begin{cases}1-1/n& x=0\\ 1/n & x = n^2 \end{cases}.$$
We established that $X_n\overset{p}{\to}0$, so an estimator with this
distribution would be a consistent estimator for $0$. Despite this, the
estimator would not be asymptotically unbiased, as
$\text{E}\left[X_n\right] = n$, which tends to infinity as $n$ grows.

:::

:::{#exm-}
## Asymptotically Unbiased, Not Consistent
For $X_i\overset{iid}{\sim}N(\mu,\sigma^2)$, define the estimator
$\hat\mu(\mathbf{X}) = X_1$. We simply take the first observation to be
our estimate of $\mu$. This estimator is unbiased,
$$\text{E}\left[\hat\mu\right] = \text{E}\left[X_1\right] = \mu,$$ so it
is asymptotically unbiased. Nevertheless, the estimator fails to be
consistent, as
$$\lim_{n\to\infty} \Pr (|\hat\mu - \mu| > \varepsilon)= \lim_{n\to\infty} \left\{1 - 2\left[\Phi\left(\frac{\varepsilon}{\sigma}\right) - \frac{1}{2}\right]\right\} \neq 0 .$$
:::

       The incompatibility of asymptotic unbiasedness and consistency is due to
the behavior of $\text{Var}\left(X_n\right)$ as $n\to\infty$.

::: {#prp-consbias}
## Relating Consistency and Asymptotic Unbiasedness

Suppose $\hat\theta$ is an estimator for $\theta$.

1.  If $\hat\theta$ is consistent and there exists some $M$ such that
    $\text{Var}\left(\hat\theta\right) \le M$ for all $n$ (bounded
    variance), then $\hat\theta$ is asymptotically unbiased.
2.  If $\hat\theta$ is asymptotically unbiased and
    $\lim_{n\to\infty}\text{Var}\left(\hat\theta\right) = 0$ (vanishing
    variance), then $\hat\theta$ is consistent

## Laws of Large Numbers

In most examples until now, the properties of estimators were implicitly
a function of the underlying model the data is generated from. We
established that $\bar X$ and $S^2$ are consistent estimators for $\mu$
and $\sigma^2$, respectively, *when*
$X_i \overset{iid}{\sim}N(\mu,\sigma^2)$. We know the distribution of
$\bar X$, *when* $X_i \overset{iid}{\sim}N(\mu,\sigma^2)$. In an ideal
world, we would be able to establish desirable properties of estimators
under more robust settings where our specified model may include a wide
array of distributions. Our first step in doing this will be introducing
variants of one of the most important results in all of probability -- the law of
large numbers (LLN). In the context of estimation, LLNs give sufficient conditions for our favorite estimator, $\bar X$, to be consistent. 

### Khinchine's Weak Law of Large Numbers

The version of the LLN we'll use the most often deals with convergence in probability. To prove that $\bar X \overset{p}{\to}\mu$ we'll rely on an inequality similar to
@lem-markovineq.

::: {#lem-}
## Chebyshev's Inequality

If $X$ is a random variable with an expected value $\mu$ and variance
$\sigma^2$, then for all $a > 0$
$$\Pr(|X - \mu| \ge k) \le \frac{\sigma^2}{k^2}.$$
:::

::: proof

\begin{align*}
\Pr(|X - \mu| \ge k) &= \Pr((X - \mu)^2 \ge k^2)\\
& \le \frac{\text{E}\left[(X-\mu)^2\right]}{k^2} & (\text{Markov's Inequality})\\
& = \frac{\sigma^2}{k^2}
\end{align*}

:::

::: {#thm-}
## LLN I

If $(X_1,\ldots, X_n)$ are a set of iid random variables where
$\text{E}\left[X_i\right] = \mu$, then $\bar X \overset{p}{\to}\mu$.
:::

::: proof
Recall that $\text{Var}\left(\bar X\right) = \sigma^2/n$. By Chebyshev's
Inequality, \begin{align*}
\lim_{n\to\infty}\Pr(|X_n - \mu| \ge \varepsilon) \le \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{(\sigma^2/n)}{\varepsilon^2} =   \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\sigma^2}{n\varepsilon} = 0.
\end{align*} Therefore, $\bar X\overset{p}{\to}\mu$.
:::

:::{#exm-lln1}

To illustrate the LLN, let's simulate realizations of iid random
variables from a series of different distributions and show that
regardless of the distribution, $\bar X \to \mu$. We will use the
following distributions: \begin{align*}
X_i & \overset{iid}{\sim}\text{Exp}(1/\mu)\\
X_i & \overset{iid}{\sim}\chi_\mu^2\\
X_i & \overset{iid}{\sim}\text{Uni}(0, 2\mu)\\
X_i & \overset{iid}{\sim}\text{Gamma}(2\mu, 2)\\
X_i & \overset{iid}{\sim}\text{HyperGeo}(10, 20, 15\mu)
\end{align*} All these distributions have been selected such that
$\text{E}\left[X_i\right] = \mu$. For our simulations, we will take
$\mu = 5$. If we plot the value of the sample mean versus the sample
size $n$, we see that the values converge to the true value $\mu = 5$
regardless of the distribution of $X_i$.

    ) %>%

For the sake of an even better illustration, let's focus on the case where $X_i \overset{iid}{\sim}\text{Exp}(1/\mu)$ where $\mu = 5$. We'll draw 10,000 samples of $X_i$, and calculate $\bar X$ for each sample as the sample size ranges from 1 all the way to 1,000.

```{r}

  N = 1e4, 
  n = 1e3, 
  dist = rexp, 
  dist_label = "rexp", 
  dist_params = list(

  geom_hline(yintercept = 5 + 0.5, color = "red", linetype="dashed") +

The weak LLN tells us that since $\bar X\pto 5$, then by the definition of convergence in probability, the probability one of the lines falls in @fig-plot28.2 outside the interval within the red dashed lines at a particular sample size $n$ approaches zero as $n\to \infty$. Furthermore, this will hold regardless of how close we make the red lines to the true value $\mu = 5$. For the sake of illustration we took $\varepsilon = 0.5$, but it will hold *for all* $\varepsilon > 0$. In fact, we can go one step further and illustrate $\Pr(|\bar X-\mu| > \varepsilon)$ by looking at the proportion of times that $|\bar X-\mu| > \varepsilon$ holds across out 10,000 simulations. We'll do this for $\varepsilon=0.5,0.6,\ldots,1$.

## Monte Carlo Simulations

In @exm-var we performed a Monte Carlo simulation to illustrate the bias
of $\hat\theta(\mathbf{X}) = \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar X)/n$ and
unbiasedness of $S^2$. We did this by fixing $n=20$, drawing a random
sample, recording estimates $\hat\theta(\mathbf{x})$ and
$S^2(\mathbf{x})$, and repeating this $k$ times. This is nothing more
than drawing $j=1,\ldots,k$ observations from the random variables
$\hat\theta(\mathbf{X})$ and $S^2(\mathbf{X})$. By the LLN,
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^k \hat\theta_j(\mathbf{x}) &\overset{p}{\to}\text{E}\left[\hat\theta(\mathbf{X})\right],\\
\frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^k S_j^2(\mathbf{x}) &\overset{p}{\to}\text{E}\left[S^2(\mathbf{X})\right],
\end{align*} so for a large enough $k$, we can approximate the expected
value with its sample counterpart.

### Kolmogorov's Strong Law of Large Numbers

A stronger version of the LLN is stated in terms of almost sure convergence. Since almost sure convergence is stronger than convergence in probability (which is all that is needed for an estimator to be consistent), this version is referred to as the "strong" LLN. 

::: {#thm-}
## LLN II

$\text{E}\left[X_i\right] = \mu$, then $\bar X \overset{as}{\to}\mu$.

## Strong vs Weak LLN
We can actually visualize the difference between the strong and weak LLNs, and in doing so highlight the difference between almost sure convergence and convergence in probability. Like @exm-lln1, assume $X_i \sim\text{Exp}(1/\mu)$ where $\mu = 5$. We'll perform a similar simulation to that which gave @fig-plot28.2, but this time we'll only look at one sample of $X_i$ (instead of 10,000).

  geom_hline(yintercept = 5 + 0.5, color = "red", linetype="dashed") +

```

The strong LLN tells us that for some finite sample size $N$ the line in @fig-plot28.4 will fall within the red lines for all $n > N$.

### Chebyshev's Weak Law of Large Numbers

The crucial assumption made by both LLNs up to this point is that $\bar X$ is calculated
with an iid random sample. If we drop this assumption, then $\bar X$
needn't estimate $\mu$ consistently.

::: {#exm-noiid}
## LLN Failing with Non-IID Data

Suppose $\mathbf{X}= (X_1, \ldots, X_n)$ where $X_i \sim N(-1, i)$ if
$i$ is odd, and $X_i \sim N(1,i)$ is $i$ is even. The data is
independent, but not identically distributed. If some LLN would hold
here, we would suspect that $\bar X$ would converge $0$ since the average of
the underlying population means $1$ and $-1$. Let's simulate $\bar X$ for
$n$ ranging from 1 to 100,000.

```{r}
draw_X_i <- function(i){
  mu_i <- (-1)^(i %% 2) * (1)^(1 - i %% 2)
  sigma_i <- i 
  
  output <- rnorm(1, mu_i, sigma_i)
  return(output)
}

draw_X <- function(n){
  output <- tibble(
    i = 1:n,
    value = map_dbl(1:n, draw_X_i)
  ) %>% 
    mutate(estimate = cummean(value))
  return(output)
}

results <- draw_X(1e5)
```

We see that our estimates very much do not converge to any particular
value.

       The proof of the LLN relied on Chebyshev's equality and the fact that
$\text{Var}\left(\bar X\right) = \sigma^2/n \to 0$ when
$\text{Var}\left(X_i\right) = \sigma^2$. Perhaps if we added an
assumption regarding the variance of a non-iid sample, then we could
salvage a result similar to the LLN. This is precisely what Chebyshev's
LLN does.

## Chebyshev's (Weak) Law of Large Numbers

$\text{E}\left[X_i\right] = \mu_i$,
$\text{Cov}\left(X_i, X_j\right) = \sigma_{ij}^2$, and
$\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_{ij}^2 =0$. If
$\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\mu_i \overset{p}{\to}\mu$, then
$\bar X \overset{p}{\to}\mu$.

The variance is
$$ \text{Var}\left(\bar X\right) = \text{Var}\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i\right) = \frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^n\text{Cov}\left(X_i,X_j\right) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_{ij}^2\to 0.$$

$\bar X \overset{p}{\to}\mu$.

The reason our non-iid sample in Example @exm-noiid did not converge was
because
$$ \frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i^2 = \frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{1}{n^2}\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n^2 + n}{2n^2} \to \frac{1}{2} \neq 0.$$
Let's modify it slightly so the sum of the variances does converge to
zero.

Suppose $\mathbf{X}= (X_1, \ldots, X_n)$ where $X_i \sim N(-1,i^{-1})$
if $i$ is odd, and $X_i \sim N(1,i^{-1})$ is $i$ is even. Now we have
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i^2 = \left[\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n^2}\right]\sum_{i=1}^\infty i^{-1} \to 0 .$$

```{r}
draw_X_i <- function(i){
  mu_i <- (-1)^(i %% 2) * (1)^(1 - i %% 2)
  sigma_i <- 1/i 
  
  output <- rnorm(1, mu_i, sigma_i)
  return(output)
}

draw_X <- function(n){
  output <- tibble(
    i = 1:n,
    value = map_dbl(1:n, draw_X_i)
  ) %>% 
    mutate(estimate = cummean(value))
  return(output)
}

results <- draw_X(150)
```

Now we see that $\bar X$ is converging to $0$, and doing so rather
quickly.

## The Continuous Mapping Theorem and Slutsky's Theorem

At first glance, the LLN may not seem especially useful as it only
applies to the sample mean. However, when paired with two key results
about convergence, the LLN becomes an indispensable tool to analyze the
convergence of many random variables and estimators. The first of these
is an extension of a key result in real analysis. A useful, and defining
property, of continuous functions is that they preserve limits of
numeric sequences. If $\{a_n\}$ is a numeric sequence, then
$$\lim_{n \to\infty} f(a_n) = f\left(\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n\right) \iff f\text{ continuous}.$$

:::{#thm-}

## Continuous Mapping Theorem I

Suppose $X_n \overset{p}{\to}X$, and let $g$ be a continuous function.
Then $$g(X_n)\overset{p}{\to}g(X).$$ In other words we are able to
interchange the $\mathop{\mathrm{plim}}$ operator with a continuous
function:
$$\mathop{\mathrm{plim}}g(X_n) = g\left(\mathop{\mathrm{plim}}X_n\right).$$

:::

The proof of this result can be found in @van2000asymptotic. An
immediate corollary follows from the fact that convergence in
probability implies convergence in distribution.

::: {#cor-}
## Continuous Mapping Theorem II

Suppose $X_n \overset{p}{\to}X$, and let $g$ be a continuous function.
Then $$g(X_n)\overset{d}{\to}g(X)$$
:::

An equally useful result involves the limit of a sums and products of
convergent random variables.

:::{#thm-}

## Slusky's Theorem

Let $X_n$ and $Y_n$ be sequences of random variables. If
$X_n\overset{d}{\to}X$ for some random variable $X$, and
$Y_n\overset{p}{\to}c$ for some constant $c$, then \begin{align*}
X_n + Y_n &\overset{d}{\to}X + c\\
X_nY_n & \overset{d}{\to}Xc.
\end{align*} Furthermore, if $c\neq 0$,
$$ X_n/Y_n \overset{d}{\to}X/c.$$

:::

::: proof
Define a random vector to be $\mathbf Z_n = (X_n,Y_n)$. We have
$\mathbf Z_n \overset{d}{\to}(X,c)$ as $X_n\overset{d}{\to}X$ and
$Y_n \overset{d}{\to}c$ (convergence in probability implies convergence
in distribution). We can apply the continuous mapping theorem to
$g(x,y) = x + y$, $g(x,y)=xy$, and $g(x/y)$ to establish the result.
:::

       Slutsky's theorem can be a bit hard to remember because it involves a
sequence of random variable which converges in distribution to a random
variable, and a sequence of random variables which converges in
probability to a constant. These asymmetries in mode of convergence and
the type of limit are essential, otherwise the result will not hold.
Fortunately, the result does hold if we replace all convergences in
distribution with convergence in probability (as the later implies the
prior).

:::{#exm-}

Suppose $X_n \sim\text{Uni}(0,1)$ and $Y_n = - X_n$. We have
$X_n \overset{d}{\to}\text{Uni}(0,1)$ and
$Y_n \overset{d}{\to}\text{Uni}(-1,0)$. Despite this
$X_n + Y_n = 0 \not\overset{d}{\to}\text{Uni}(0,1) + \text{Uni}(-1,0).$

## Consistency of Sample Variance

@exm-consvarnorm showed that $S^2$ is a consistent estimator for
$\sigma^2$ when $X_i\overset{iid}{\sim}N(\mu,\sigma^2)$. We can use the
continuous mapping theorem, Slutsky's theorem, and the LLN to show that
$S^2$ is consistent regardless of the distribution of our iid sample.
Suppose $\text{E}\left[X_i\right] = \mu$,
$\text{E}\left[X_i^2\right]=\mu_2$, and
$\text{E}\left[X_i^4\right]=\mu_4$ for all $i$. If we define our
continuous function to be $g(x) = x^2$, then \begin{align*}
S^2 & = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^nX_i - \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n\bar X^2 \\
    & = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^nX_i^2 + \frac{n}{n-1}\bar X^2  \\
    & = \frac{n}{n-1}\left[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i^2 - \left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i\right)^2\right]
\end{align*} The first term in the brackets is an unbiased estimator of
$\mu_2$ with vanishing variance, so by @prp-consbias it is a consistent
estimator for $\text{E}\left[X^2\right]$: \begin{align*}
\text{E}\left[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i^2\right] &= \frac{1}{n}\left(n \mu_2\right) = \mu^2\\
\lim_{n\to\infty}\text{Var}\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i^2\right) & = \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n^2}n\left(\text{E}\left[X_i^4\right] - \text{E}\left[X_i^2\right]^2 \right) = \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\mu_4 + \mu_2^2}{n} = 0
\end{align*} The second term in the brackets can be written as
$g(\bar X)$, so by the continuous mapping theorem and the LLN,
$$ g(\bar X) = \left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i\right)^2 \overset{p}{\to}\mu^2 = g(\mu).$$
So
$$S^2= \underbrace{\frac{n}{n-1}}_{\to 1}\Bigg[\underbrace{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i^2}_{\overset{p}{\to}\mu_2} - \underbrace{\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i\right)^2}_{\overset{p}{\to}\mu^2} \Bigg].$$
We can apply Slutsky's theorem to the sum of sequences of random
variables which converge in probability to constants, so
$$ S^2 \overset{p}{\to}\mu_2 - \mu^2 = \sigma^2,$$ making $S^2$
consistent.
:::

## Central Limit Theorems

The LLN told us that our favorite estimator for $\mu$, $\bar X$, is
consistent. We know turn to what is perhaps an even more important
result regarding $\bar X$, one that may in fact be the most important
results in all of probability -- the asymptotic distribution of $\bar X$ is a normal distribution.

### Lindeberg-Lévy CLT

The *classic* version of the CLT is formally known as the Lindeberg-Lévy CLT, and is likely familiar.

:::{#thm-}

## CLT I

Suppose $\mathbf{X}=(X_1,\ldots, X_n)$ is a sequence of random variables
with $\text{E}\left[X_i\right]=\mu$ and
$\text{Var}\left(X_i\right)=\sigma^2$. Then
$$\sqrt{n}(\bar X - \mu) \overset{d}{\to}N(0,\sigma^2),$$ which is also
often written as $$\bar X\overset{d}{\to}N(\mu, \sigma^2/n),$$ or
$$\sum_{i=1}^n X_i \overset{d}{\to}N(n\mu, \sqrt n \sigma^2) $$
:::

       The proof is a bit technical and requires some measure-theoretic based
probability theory. It can be found in @billingsley2008probability or
@durrett2019probability.

:::{#exm-}
Suppose we have an iid sample from $\text{Exp}(1)$. If we simulate 1000
realizations of $\sqrt n(\bar X - \mu)$ for various sample sizes, we
should see that the distribution of our realizations becomes
approximately normal as we increase the sample size.

```{r}
results <- draw_N_estimates_over_n(
  theta = function(X){sqrt(length(X))*(mean(X) - 1)},
  N = 1e4,
  n_vals = c(1:25, 50, (1:10)*100),
  dist = rexp,
  dist_params = list(
    rate = 1
  )
)
```

Even for modest values of $n$, we can see that
$\sqrt n(\bar X - \mu) \overset{a}{\sim}N(0, \sigma^2)$.

An alternate way to visually test whether our estimates are normally
distributed is with a quantile-quantile plot (QQ-plot), which graphs the
observed quantiles of our estimates against the theoretical quantiles of
a normal distribution (or those of any distribution we suspect our data
is drawn from). If our estimates are (approximately) normally
distributed, then the observed quantiles should be approximately equal
to the theoretical quantiles of a normal distribution, forming a
45-degree line.

       The central limit theorem is similar to the LLN insofar that they only
concern the estimator $\bar X$, so how useful can they really be? Well
with the continuous mapping theorem and Slutsky's theorem, the answer is
*very useful*!

:::{#exm-}

In @exm-tdist we illustrated the fact that
$X_n \overset{d}{\to}N(0,1)$ where $X_n \sim t_n$, but we didn't
actually prove it. Directly proving this result is a matter of verify
that
$$\lim_{n\to\infty} F_{X_n}(x) =\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_{-\infty}^x \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)\sqrt{n\pi}}\left(1 + \frac{x^2}{n}\right)^{-\frac{n+1}{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^x e^{-x^2/2} = F_X(x)$$
where $\Gamma$ is the gamma function defined as
$$\Gamma(t) = \int_0^\infty s^{t-1}e^{-s}\ ds.$$ A much easier way to
prove that $X_n \overset{d}{\to}N(0,1)$, is by using Slutsky's theorem
and the continuous mapping theorem. First recall that
$$\frac{\bar X - \mu}{S/\sqrt n} \sim t_n,$$ so we can write $X_n$ as
$X_n = \frac{\bar X - \mu}{S/\sqrt n}$ due to the fact that random
variables are uniquely determined by their distributions. From
@exm-consvarnorm, we have $S^2 \overset{p}{\to}\sigma^2$. By the continuous
mapping theorem
$$ \sqrt{S^2} = S \overset{p}{\to}\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2},$$ which gives
$$ X_n = \frac{\bar X - \mu}{S/\sqrt n}= \underbrace{\sqrt{n}(\bar X - \mu)}_{\overset{d}{\to}N(0, \sigma^2)}\underbrace{\frac{1}{s}}_{\overset{p}{\to}\sigma}.$$
Putting all the pieces together, Slutsky's theorem yields
$$X_n \overset{d}{\to}\frac{N(0,\sigma^2)}{\sigma} = N(0,1).$$

       The CLT can be generalized to samples of random vectors $\mathbf{X}_i$.

random vectors with $\text{E}\left[\mathbf{X}_i\right]=\boldsymbol\mu$

$$\sqrt{n}(\bar {\mathbf{X}}- \boldsymbol\mu) \overset{d}{\to}N(\mathbf{0},\boldsymbol\Sigma).$$

### Not Identically Distributed

@prp-chebylln allowed us to salvage a LLN when the iid assumption failed, so can we do the same with the CLT? Sort of. While we need an independent sample, we don't necessarily need realizations to be drawn from an identical distribution. Instead, the theorem will rely on the tails of distributions meeting a certion criterion. This version of the CLT is known as the Lindeberg-Feller CLT.

:::{#thm-}

## Lindeberg-Feller CLT

Suppose $\mathbf{X}=(X_1,\ldots, X_n)$ is a sequence of independent
random variables with $\text{E}\left[X_i\right]=\mu_i$ and
$\text{Var}\left(X_i\right)=\sigma_i^2$, and define \begin{align*}
\bar \mu = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\mu_i;\\
\bar \sigma_n^2 = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\sigma_i^2.
\end{align*} If the collection of variances $\sigma_i^2$ satisfies:
\begin{align*}
\lim_{n\to\infty} &\frac{\max\{\sigma_i\}}{n\bar\sigma} = 0;\\
\lim_{n\to\infty} &\bar\sigma_n^2 = \bar\sigma^2,
\end{align*} then
$\sqrt n (\bar X-\mu)\overset{d}{\to}N(0, \bar\sigma^2).$

:::

::: {#exm-}

## Lindeberg's Condition

The Lindeberg-Feller conditions stipulates that
$\lim_{n\to\infty}\bar\sigma_n^2 = \bar\sigma^2$ and
$\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\max\{\sigma_i\}}{n\bar\sigma} = 0$, a
condition known as the ***Lindeberg's condition***. The condition is
often presented in more general terms, but the intuition remains the
same. For the CLT to hold for random variables that with different
variances, we need to makes sure that no single term $\sigma_i$
dominates the standard deviation. We can think about the sample mean
$\bar X$ as "mixing" many random variables $X_i.$ After mixing these
random variables, we hope to have a normal distribution, but that only
happens if tails of the various distributions of $X_i$ are negligible as
$n\to\infty$, giving us the trademark tails of a normal distribution
which tapper off. Let's consider a counterexample. Suppose $X_i$ is
defined on the sample space $\{-i,0,i\}$ is distributed such that
$$\Pr(X_i = k) = \begin{cases} 1/2i^2 & k = -i^2 \\ 1/2i^2 & k = i^2 \\ 1 - 1/i^2&k=0\end{cases}.$$
Graphing the density function for a few values of $i$ gives us a better
sense of how $X_i$ behaves.

  filter(x == i^2 | x == -i^2| x== 0) %>% 
  mutate(y = ifelse(x == 0, 1 - 1/(i^2), 1/(2*i^2))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.2) +
  xlab("k") +
  geom_segment(aes(x = x, xend = x, y= 0, yend = y)) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  transition_states(i) + 
  labs(title = 'i = {closest_state}', y = "Pr(X_i = k)")
```

As $i\to\infty$, nearly all the probability is concentrated as $k = 0$.
The remaining probability is at the extreme tails of the distribution
$\pm i^2$, and these tails become more and more extreme (quadritically
so) as $i\to\infty$. This is the exact type of behavior Lindeberg's
condition rules out. The expectation, expectation squared, and variance
of $X_i$ are: \begin{align*}
\text{E}\left[X_i\right] & = (1/2i^2)(-i^2) + (1/2i^2)(i^2) +  (1 - 1/i^2)(0) = 0\\
\text{E}\left[X_i^2\right] & = (1/2i^2)(i^4) + (1/2i^2)(i^4) +  (1 - 1/i^2)(0) = i^2\\
\text{Var}\left(X_i\right) & = i^2 - 0^2 = i^2
\end{align*}

We can verify that Lindeberg's condition does not hold. \begin{align*}
\lim_{n\to\infty}\bar \sigma_n = \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n i^2 = \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \to\infty
\end{align*}

To simulate realizations of this random variable, we can define $X_i$
using $U_i\sim\text{Uni}(0,1)$.[^asymptotics-1]

$$X_i = \begin{cases}-i^2 & U_i\in[0, 1/2i^2)\\ i^2 & U_i\in[1/2i^2, 1/i^2) \\ 0 & U_i\in [1/i^2,1]\end{cases}$$

The apparent distribution of our estimates is not converging to a normal
distribution, as we always have a few outliers that are too plentiful
relative to their distance from the mean to be drawn from a normal
distribution. As $n\to\infty$ these outliers become even more extreme.
This is also evident from QQ-plots, where the points far away from the
45-degree line are drawn even farther away as $n\to\infty$.

$\bar\sigma = (1/n)\sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i.$

:::

## Delta Method

Slutsky's theorem and the continuous mapping theorem in tandem with the
LLN give us the ability to prove that certain functions of sample means
are convergent. Is it possible that we can do something similar with the
CLT to find the asymptotic distribution of functions of sample means?

       Suppose $g$ is a function of $\bar X$, where a CLT applies to the random
sample $\mathbf{X}$. We know
$\sqrt n(\bar X-\mu)\overset{a}{\sim}N(0, \sigma^2)$. Is it possible to
conclude that
$\sqrt n(g(\bar X)-g(\mu))\overset{a}{\sim}N(0, \tilde\sigma^2)$ for
some $\tilde\sigma^2$? Furthermore, can we determine $\tilde\mu$ and
$\tilde\sigma^2$ only knowing $g$, $\mu$, and $\sigma^2$?

       We have information about the difference $\bar X-\mu$ and want
information about the difference $g(\bar X)-g(\mu)$. Situations where we
know something about behavior in the domain of a function and want to
relate it to the function's behavior in the codomain are common place in
math, but in particular in real analysis. This is where the mean value
theorem saves the day. Assuming $g$ is continuously differentiable and
fixing $n$, there exists some $T_n$ in between $\bar X$ and $\theta$
($\bar X< T_n < \mu$ or $\mu < T_n < \bar X$) such that: \begin{align*}
& \frac{g(\bar X)-g(\mu)}{\bar X - \mu} = g'(T_n)\\
\implies & g(\bar X) = g(\mu) + g'(T_n)(\bar X-\mu)\\
\implies & \sqrt{n}[g(\bar X) - g(\mu)] = g'(T_n)\sqrt{n} (\bar X-\mu)
\end{align*} If we let $n$ vary, we have a sequence of random variables
$\{T_n\}$ such that
$\left\lvert T_n -\mu\right\rvert < \left\lvert\bar X - \mu\right\rvert$.
By the LLN $\left\lvert\bar X - \mu\right\rvert \overset{p}{\to}0$, so
$\left\lvert T_n -\mu\right\rvert \overset{p}{\to}0$, which is
equivalent to $T_n \overset{p}{\to}\mu$. By the continuous mapping
theorem, $g(T_n) \overset{p}{\to}g(\mu)$. This means
$$\sqrt{n}[g(\bar X) - g(\mu)] = \underbrace{g'(T_n)}_{\overset{p}{\to}g(\mu)}\cdot\underbrace{\sqrt{n} (\bar X-\mu)}_{\overset{d}{\to}N(0, \sigma^2)},$$
so Slutsky's theorem gives
$$\sqrt{n}[g(\bar X) - g(\mu)] \overset{d}{\to}g(\mu)\cdot N(0,\sigma^2) = N(0, \sigma^2[g(\mu)]^2).$$
This all is contingent on $g$ not being a function of $n$, otherwise
things fall apart when we apply limiting processes.

       This result is known as the delta method, and applies to any sequence of
random variables that is asymptotically normal. It is also readily
generalized to higher dimensions where $\mathbf g$ is a vector valued
function.

to the delta method we have \begin{align*}
&\sqrt{n}[g(\bar X) - g(1)]  \overset{a}{\sim}N(0, 1[g'(1)]^2),\\
\implies & \sqrt{n}\left[\bar X^2 - 1\right] \overset{a}{\sim}N(0, 4).
\end{align*}

```{r}
g <- function(t){
  t^2 + 3
}

results <- draw_N_estimates(
  theta = function(X){sqrt(length(X))*(g(mean(X)) - g(1))},
  N = 1e4,
  n = 1e5,
  dist = rexp,
  dist_params = list(
    rate = 1
  )
)
```

We can plot a histogram of our estimates and overlay the distribution
$N(0,4)$.

  theme_minimal() +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 2), color = "red")
```

:::

       The big takeaway from the delta method is that estimators which are nice
functions of sample means will be asymptotically distributed according
to a normal distribution. Furthermore, any nice function of such an
estimator will also have a normal asymptotic distribution!

## Little $o_p$, Big $O_p$, and Taylor Expansions

We've talked a lot about whether or not random variables converge, and
how they converge, but not the rate at which they converge. We can
introduce some notation that allows us to quantify this rate.

:::{#def-}

Given a sequence of random variables $X_n$, we say $X_n$ is [***little
"O.P" of*** $n^k$]{style="color:red"}, denoted $X_n = o_p(n^k)$, if
$X_n / n^k\overset{p}{\to}0$.

:::

       Note that $X_n\overset{p}{\to}0$ implies that $X_n = o_p(1)$. The use of
"=" is a bit misleading in this definition, as $X_n = o_p(n^k)$ does not
establish any equality, instead referring to how $X_n$ behaves
asymptotically. For instance, if we have two sequences of random
variables $X_n$ and $Y_n$ such that $X_n\overset{p}{\to}X$ and
$Y_n\overset{p}{\to}0$, we have \$ X_n + Y_n \overset{p}{\to} X + 0 \$,
but could write $X_n + Y_n$ as $X_n + o_p(1)$. This emphasizes the
sequence $X_n$, and frames $Y_n$ as some negligible remainder term that
tends to zero.

:::{#def-}

Given a sequence of random variables $X_n$, we say $X_n$ is [***big
"O.P" of*** $n^k$]{style="color:red"}, denoted $X_n = O_p(n^k)$, if for
all $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists some $\delta$ and $N$ such that
$\Pr(|X_n/n^k| \ge \delta) <\varepsilon$ for all $n > N$. In other
words, $X_n/n^k$ is [***bounded in probability***]{style="color:red"}.

:::

       We are most interested in the case where $X_n = O_p(1)$. If this is the
case, then as $n\to\infty$, we can bound the area in the tails of
$f_{X_n}$ by some constant $\delta$ such that the area is negligible
(less than $\varepsilon$).

:::{#exm-}

We know that $\bar X \overset{d}{\to}N(\mu, \sigma^2/n)$ when
$\mathbf{X}$ is an iid sample. We have that $\bar X = O_p(1)$. We have
$$\Pr(|\bar X/1| \ge \delta) = \Pr(-\bar X\ge -\delta \text{ and }\delta \le \bar X) = 2\cdot\Pr(\bar X\ge \delta) = 2\left[1 - \Phi\left(\frac{\delta - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt n}\right)\right].$$
If we take the limit of this as $n\to \infty$ we have
$$ \lim_{n\to \infty}\Pr(|X\bar X/1| \ge \delta) = \lim_{n\to \infty}2\left[1 - \Phi\left(\frac{\delta - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt n}\right)\right] = 0.$$
By the definition of a limit, there must exists some $N$ such that
$\Pr(|\bar X/1| \ge \delta) < \varepsilon$ for any $n > N$, so
$\bar X = O_p(1)$.

:::

:::{#exm-}

If $X_n \overset{d}{\to}X$, then $X_n = O_p(1)$.

:::

:::{#exm-}

If $X_n = o_p(1)$, then $X_n = O_p(1)$.

:::

       A common place to encounter $o_p$ is when performing Taylor expansions.

## Taylor's Theorem

Taylor's theorem, as given in @rudin1976principles, tells us that if
$f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ is $k-$times differentiable at a point
$a\in \mathbb R$, then there is some element $c\in (a,b)$ such that
\begin{align*}
f(b) & = \sum_{j=0}^{k-1}\frac{f^{(j)}(a)}{k!}(b-a)^j + \frac{f^{(n)}(c)}{k!}(b-a)^k.
\end{align*} For $n = 2$, we have the mean value theorem:
$$ f(b)= f(a) + f'(c)(b-a).$$ If we let $a\to b$, then \begin{align*}
&\lim_{a\to b}f(b)  = \sum_{j=0}^{k-1}\lim_{a\to b}\frac{f^{(j)}(a)}{j!}(b-a)^j + \lim_{a\to b}\frac{f^{(k)}(c)}{k!}(b-a)^k.\\
\implies & f(b)  =\lim_{a\to b} f(a) + \sum_{j=1}^{k-1}\lim_{a\to b}\frac{f^{(j)}(a)}{j!}(b-a)^j +  \lim_{a\to b}\frac{f^{(k)}(c)}{k!}(b-a)^k\\
\implies & f(b)  = f(b) + \underbrace{\sum_{j=1}^{k-1}\frac{f^{(j)}(b)}{j!}(b-b)^j}_0 + \lim_{a\to b}\frac{f^{(k)}(c)}{k!}(b-a)^k\\
\implies & \lim_{a\to b}\frac{f^{(k)}(c)}{n!}(b-a)^k = 0\\
\implies & \lim_{a\to b}\frac{f^{(k)}(c)}{n!(b-a)^k} = 0\\
\implies & \frac{f^{(k)}(c)}{k!} = o(|a-b|^k)\\
\end{align*} Here, $o$ is the deterministic counterpart of $o_p$ (we're
not working with random variables just yet). This means we can write
Taylor's theorem as
$$ f(b) = \sum_{j=0}^{k-1}\frac{f^{(j)}(a)}{j!}(b-a)^k +o(|a-b|^k).$$ In
the event $f$ is infinitely differentiable we can make this
approximation arbitrarily accurate, giving rise toa function's Taylor
series.

Now suppose $f_n(X)$ is a sequence of functions of random variables,
where the subscript $n$ emphasizes that $f_n$ is a random variable. IF
we apply Taylor's theorem to $f_n(X)$ we have
$$f_n(b) = \sum_{j=0}^{k-1}\frac{f_n^{(j)}(a)}{j!}(b-a)^k +o_p(|a-b|^k)$$
for realizations of the random variable $a,b,c\in\mathcal X$ where
$c\in(a,b)$. Assuming $k \ge 1$, then $o_p(|a-b|^k)$ implies $o_p(1)$,
so $$f_n(b) = \sum_{j=0}^{k-1}\frac{f_n^{(j)}(a)}{j!}(b-a)^k +o_p(1).$$

## Asymptotically Normal Estimators

When putting our asymptotic tools to work on an estimator of interest,
we will almost always find that it converges to a normal distribution,
is consistent, and that the rate of convergence is linked to $\sqrt{n}$.

:::{#def-}

An estimator $\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}$ is [$\sqrt{n}-$consistent
asymptotically normal (root-n CAN)]{style="color:red"}, if
$$\sqrt{n}(\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}- \boldsymbol{\theta}) \overset{d}{\to}N(\mathbf 0, \mathbf V)$$
for a PSD matrix $\mathbf V$. Equivalently,
$$ \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\overset{a}{\sim}N(\boldsymbol{\theta}, \mathbf V/n).$$
We refer to $\mathbf V/n$ as the [***asymptotic
variance***]{style="color:red"} of $\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}$ and write
$\text{Avar}\left(\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\right) = \mathbf V /n$.

:::

       "$\sqrt n-$" emphasizes the fact that
$\sqrt{n}(\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} - \boldsymbol{\theta}) = O_p(1)$,
which is equivalent to
$\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} = \boldsymbol{\theta}+ O_p(n^{-1/2})$. In
other words, as $n\to\infty$ the error term associated with our estimate
decreases at a rate of $n^{1/2}$. A fourfold increase in observations
results in half the error. We also have that
$\sqrt{n}(\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} - \boldsymbol{\theta}) = o_p(1)$, so
$\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\overset{p}{\to}\boldsymbol{\theta}$, hence
the "consistent" in the previous definition. We also have that
$\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}$ is asymptotically unbiased if it is root-n
CAN, as
$\text{E}\left[\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\right]\to \boldsymbol{\theta}$.
This will be the one of, if not the, ***most important property*** an
estimator can posses.
